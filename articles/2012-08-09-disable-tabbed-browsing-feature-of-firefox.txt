so, yeah.  
Tabbed browsing makes my websurfing activity biased.  

###why?
because if I'm interested with a link - no matter if it relevant with anything that I'm doing right now - I can open it. **_in a new tab_**.  
that makes me not focused with what am I doing, because the irrelevant link drive me away.  

###well, kill the tab!
this addon will disable tabbed browsing feature of firefox. if you try to open up a link in a new tab, it 'll open a new window instead. neeeaat.  

###it isn't compatible with my firefox version :(
install [checkCompability](https://addons.mozilla.org/id/firefox/addon/checkcompatibility/) addon first, and you're good to go.

p.s: install [pentadactyl](http://5digits.org/pentadactyl/) extension for more zen. also, I recommend to set `:set guioptions=bCsn` and `:set showtabline=never` inside pentadactyl's ex mode.
