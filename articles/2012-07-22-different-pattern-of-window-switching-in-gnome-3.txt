description: the different pattern of window switching in gnome 3

Just noticed that in Gnome 3, `Alt + Tab` key can't be used to switch between windows. Instead, they __*switching between apps*__.  

use `Alt +`` key - yeah, that key on the top of Tab key - to __*switch between windows of the same apps*__.
