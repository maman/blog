Hilarious.  
consider these examples of the posted tweets:  

> * Portrait of a dandelion with a suspiciously shallow depth of field for a cell phone.
> * Teenager from a boy band you've never heard of. Thousands of likes.
> * Female hand grasping expensive beverage
> * Highly saturated HDR of city skyline letterboxed by black bars.
> * Blurry photo of three hot chicks youâ€™ll never date

and this one is my favorite:

> feet
