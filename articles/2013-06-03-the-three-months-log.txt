1. I'm back on OSX!
2. I made two projects for my task at the Uni - [GolekKewan](http://github.com/maman/Golek-Kewan) and [ABCee!](http://abcee.mahardi.me)
3. I made my own safari extension for [dotCSS](https://github.com/stewart/dotcss), avalaible from [here](https://github.com/maman/dotcss.safariextension)
4. Made a switch from [LESS]() to [SASS](). mainly because I *can*.
5. Discovered [this](http://payungteduh.blogspot.com) band. you should check out *'Untuk Perempuan yang sedang di pelukan'* and *'Berdua Saja'*.
6. Start blogging stuff again!

That's it, folks. 

by the way, there's new Codekit alternative for windows called [Prepros](http://alphapixels.com/prepros/). finally. you should check it, **fast**.
