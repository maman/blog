description: I recently discovered the Mobile Form Interaction - http://dribbble.com/shots/1254439--GIF-Mobile-Form-Interaction?list=users by Matt D. Smith, and try to port them into JS


HTML5 input `placeholder` attribute is the most amazing improvement on input element's interaction. It's able to tell what the `input` means &mdash; and can be used as `label` replacement. However, when we use `input` without `label`, the user won't know what the `input` means, because the `placeholder` text is removed when the user insert some text to the `input`.  

Dribbble user [Matt D. Smith](http://dribbble.com/mds) proposed the fix for the `placeholder` visibility:

[![GIF mobile form Interaction](http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6410/screenshots/1254439/form-animation-_gif_.gif)](http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/6410/screenshots/1254439/form-animation-_gif_.gif)

the proposed fix later inspired [Jared Verdi](https://github.com/jverdi) to create [JVFloatLabeledTextField](https://github.com/jverdi/JVFloatLabeledTextField). Those two inspired me to port the fix to HTML5 `input` element. And so, [JVFloat.js](http://maman.github.io/JVFloat.js/) was born.  

JVFloat consist of two parts &mdash; `javascript` and `css`. `javascript` was used for input detection and `class` toggling, and the `css` to control the Animation and overall styles. The styles included is very basic, so you'll need to adapt the default `css` into your site's CSS. JVFloat uses CSS3 `transform` to perform the animations, so you'll need to perform a feature detection &mdash; by using [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) or something &mdash; to detect these features. If you don't, the users won't see JVFloat's placeholder on unsupported browsers.  

JVFloat is open-source on [Github](https://github.com/maman/JVFloat.js), so adapt and modify this plugin as you like &mdash; and send me a pull request :). Also this is my first attempt to write a JQuery or Zepto plugin, so any improvement and suggestion will be *very* appreciated. tell me your suggestion on [JVFloat Issue Page](https://github.com/maman/JVFloat.js/issues), or mention me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/achmadmahardi).
