description: OSX Config for hackers and tinkerers

Recently, I'm switching over to Hackintosh, OS X 10.7.0 "Lion" to be specific.  
my first attempt isn't very nice, and I end up reformatting my HDD. but it's worth the experience :D  
after get things up, I use [this OSX for Hackers script](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx), and install [gcc without XCode](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer) - which save you 1,5 GB ;).  
next, install [Homebrew](mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) to add a package manager for your OSX. with this, you can install - almost every tools you need to hack out some projects.  

by the way, I'm formatting my OSX install HDD as HFS+ with case-sensitive enabled. which give me problems when installing Adobe's Software. Lucky, the workaround is avalaible - use [this helper script](https://bitbucket.org/lokkju/adobe_case_sensitive_volumes) to install and [rename some of them to lowercase](https://gist.github.com/1368631) ('cmon, adobe. doesn't it __easy to fix__?? ).  

Later i'll share my findings - and new interesting things on developing with this Hackintosh. cya !
