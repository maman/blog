>Nonfree game programs (like other nonfree programs) are unethical because they deny freedom to their users. (Game art is a different issue, because it isn't software.) If you want freedom, one requisite for it is not having nonfree programs on your computer. That much is clear.

I want freedom, but I'm simply care about those people who make live by making such awesome games / platform. what will happen, if as you say, they must make their work "free" ?  
or maybe you didn't care at all, because you want them to not selling computer programs :/  
>Any GNU/Linux distro that comes with software to offer these games will teach users that the point is not freedom. Nonfree software in GNU/Linux distros already works against the goal of freedom. Adding these games to a distro would augment that effect.  

There you go. you simply pushing your idea of "freedom" to the masses.  
I think most users won't care much about their ability to modificate the programs. they'll just use it. why bother, then ? for them, the ability to use the computer to work, or play, and the computer do it flawlessly, that's freedom. itsn't just about the ability to modificate.
