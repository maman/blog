description: My MPD Config on gnome 3

Gnome 3 adds support for [MPRIS API](http://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/), which provide a mechanism for basic playback control of media players inside the Volume applet.  

sadly, [MPD](http://sourceforge.net/projects/musicpd/) isn't support the MPRIS API.  
enter [mpDris2](https://github.com/eonpatapon/mpDris2), a python-based bridge which serve as a bridge for MPD to interfacing with MPRIS API.  

I'm also a big fan of [Last.fm](http://last.fm) - my [profile](http://last.fm/user/maman__) - so I'm using [mpdscribble](https://www.ohloh.net/p/mpdscribble) to scrobble my playlist tracks to last.fm.  

Here's the autostart script that I'm using:  

    #!/bin/bash
    pidof mpd >& /dev/null
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        mpd &
    fi
    pidof mpdscribble >& /dev/null
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        mpdscribble &
    fi
    pidof python2 >& /dev/null
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        mpDris2 &
    fi

then change the permission to executable by running `chmod +x /path/to/script`, and add to autostart by using `gnome-session-properties` utility.
