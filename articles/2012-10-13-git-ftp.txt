Git-FTP is a [Git]() powered FTP Client to ease the workflow of uploading a Git-managed web project to a low-cost servers or web hosting solutions that only support FTP.  

the difference between Git-FTP and the other FTP client, Git-FTP are capable to change only modified files, instead of re-uploading the whole applications.  

seems like a nifty little addons to Git :3
