Valentine day.  
it's stupid, but [somebody made it stupid-ier](http://williamedwardscoder.tumblr.com/post/42921614369/omg-rm-rf-in-a-valentine-bash-script-and-its-partly).  

Beginning with a Hacker News post titled [Valentine greeting with bash script](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5206141), where anyone who want a 'geeky valentine greeting' are required to run a set of bash script:  

    bash <(curl https://raw.github.com/afshinm/valentine_script/master/valentine.sh) He She

Anyone who really want a 'geeky greeting' will run it in their terminal, without even inspecting the sources. Turns out that somebody has send a pull request to the script and -here's the _funny_ part- the author has accepted it. the pull request added the command  

    rm -rf ~

to the one-liner script source. it won't be visible in the output of the bash script above, but boy, it destroys your ~ sweet ~.  

sure, it's got deleted 17 minutes later, but it's on Hacker News. millions of poor 'geeks' has visited it in these period of time.  

lesson learned, never trust any command that requires you to run some scripts over the internet. even it's [RVM](https://rvm.io) (rvm is messed up, though. better off with [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/) - you're welcome.) install scripts. these 'valentine' might be yours.
