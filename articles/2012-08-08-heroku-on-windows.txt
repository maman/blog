description: Installing heroku on windows - in a hard way.

Getting heroku on windows isn't hard, but it's prety frustating. Here I'm 
using a Windows 7 x64 with sp1 installed, and [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com).  

###cygwin. first. why ?
because it's the most stable - in my opinion - "linux emulators" on the windows platform. sure, it needs some sort of compability layers, thus make it non-native, but it just works.  

and introduce yourself to [apt-cyg](http://code.google.com/p/apt-cyg/) to avoid frustation from dealing with cygwin's package manager.  
its apt-like syntax is easy and straightforward when comparing with setup.exe (yeah, cygwin uses its *installer* to act as *package manager* by default.)  

###rbenv
i'm using rbenv in place of rvm. it's like rvm - but smaller, cleaner, and stable. the syntax is mostly similiar with rvm, so you'll get no trouble from migrating.  
be sure to familiarize yourself to read `rbenv help`, though.  

###install cygwin
install cygwin as usual - just next next like a typical windows software installations.  
but beware of the software selection screen. you need to select 
`subversion` and `wget` to install. we need that to use `apt-cyg`. when you click next, the dependencies will be selected automatically, just click next again to install all, and this part is complete.  

###install apt-cyg
open cygwin shell, and run this:  

    svn --force export http://apt-cyg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ /bin/
    chmod +x /bin/apt-cyg

and now you can use apt-cyg command to manage cygwin packages. we'll start by adding development tools - you know, gcc and friends - and some additional libraries. run this to install them all:  

    apt-cyg install gcc openssl openssl-devel openssh  

also you can include `mintty` to those lines to install [mintty](http://code.google.com/p/mintty/), a better terminal to use cygwin rather than cmd.exe  

###install rbenv
it's pretty straightforward. just follow [the official install guide](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/#-2-installation).  
installing [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build) is also a good idea, since it provides a convenient `rbenv install` command to automate ruby installation process to rbenv.  
after you're done, restart mintty / cmd, and you're set.  

###install ruby and rubygems
run this command to install ruby and rubygems - in this machine, I'm using 
ruby 1.9.2-p180.  
feel free to use the other versions, you can see the supported rubies by issuing `rbenv install` command.  

    ruby-build 1.9.2-p180 ~/.rbenv/versions/1.9.2-p290 --with-openssl-dir=/usr/local  

here we used *`ruby-build`*, not *`rbenv install`*, because we need to pass `--with-openssl-dir` build config so ruby will be compiled with SSL support, which will be needed for heroku gem to work.  
this will take some time to complete, because it will compile ruby from stratch.  

after done, run `rbenv rehash` to "refresh" rbenv, so the system knows there's ruby installed by rbenv.  
also it's good to set the newly-installed ruby to be the default ruby interpreter. run this command:  

    rbenv global 1.9.2-p180  

our work is done here. check if ruby is installed with ssl support by 
running this command: 

    ruby -v
    irb
    require 'openssl' # should be '=> true'  

###install heroku gems - and login
by install ruby with rbenv, we also get `gem` commands ready to install any libraries - or gems that we need.  
in this case, we need `heroku`, `foreman`, `rb-readline`, and `bundler`. run these command to install them:  

    gem install heroku foreman rb-readline bundler

after everything ready, we need to login to heroku by using `heroku login` command. after login, we need to create a ssh public key to authenticate. [this github help articles might help](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys).  
use `heroku keys:add` to authenticate with heroku, and here we are. our machine is now equipped with a powerful linux commandline, and ruby + heroku are ready at our disposal. time to continue your work.

###tl;dr
heroku provide a tool called [heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com) that simplify the heroku CLI installations for many platforms.
