description: Review film The Amazing Spiderman

[IMDB gives this movie a 7.6 rating](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0948470/), while [Rotten Tomatoes gives 74%](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_amazing_spider_man/)  

kind of disappointed. seriously, [Andrew Garfield](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1940449/) looks like he's on weed all the time. the story is terrible, and the humor isn't good. and oh, that kissing scene between Gwen and Peter in the balcony is __horrible__, period
