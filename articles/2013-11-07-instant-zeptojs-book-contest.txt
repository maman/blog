I've teamed up with [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com) to help promoting the new book titled [Instant Zepto.js](http://www.packtpub.com/create-mobile-web-apps-with-zeptojs/book) by Ian Pointer.

Anyway, we both agree to organize a giveaway (yay!) of this book. All you need to do is head over to the [Book Page](http://www.packtpub.com/create-mobile-web-apps-with-zeptojs/book), look through the description, and tell me your thought by posting your interest or your passion to this book on your blog or website, and [mail me](mailto:achmad@mahardi.me&subject=Packt Giveaway) the link to your thoughts.  

I have three digital copies of this book for three lucky winners. good luck!
