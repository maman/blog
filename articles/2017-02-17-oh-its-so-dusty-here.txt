description: 2017 intro post

Hello 2017! just realized that I never update my blog until now - thanks to the [Malang's FB DevCircle post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DevCMalang/permalink/2031373360463356/) lol.

also for the first update since 2 years ago, here's what I'm doing:

* I've been graduated from [Ma Chung](http://www.machung.ac.id) for sometime now. I miss the parties and heartbreaks haha. [one of my friends became a star on the internet](https://twitter.com/alvansepty).
* Now I work at [Sale Stock](https://salestockindonesia.com) as Front-End engineer. I've been here since march last year (i think?), it was such a blast.
* Move to [Yogyakarta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogyakarta) since august last year. It's pretty comfy here, with burjo on every corner that keeps my coffee and ~~smoking habit~~ alive. less chilly than Bandung or Malang, but maybe thats just me. I plan to move again into a higher part of the city though.
* Polish my Programming skills up - the experience I get from [NoLimit](http://www.nolimitid.com) is unbeatable. thanks to mas hari, om wari, [mas anshor](https://ans4175.wordpress.com), [mas andi](https://blog.andi.dirgantara.co/), mas pandu, and the others at engineering team. you're such a hero to me haha.
* Got to speak at conferences/meetups throughout 2016. the most notable are [Malang DevCamp](http://malangdevcamp2016.malangphp.org) and [FB Developer Circle Malang](https://fbdevcmalangmeetup.splashthat.com). Looking for more opportunity to speak this year, so [contact me](mailto:achmad@mahardi.me) if you need to share about anything!
* I travel a lot in 2016 - mostly to Malang, because of so many friends that getting married last year. I'm happy for you guys! (Don't ask about me!)
* Had to meet so many new people with assorted interest & background, which nice to talk to.
* Also, my previous laptop is dead - the one that I feature as a background image on the [about page](/about), so I've been using office laptop now.
* One more thing. now I got a personal landing page on [https://mahardi.me](https://mahardi.me).

so yeah, thats me throughout the last 2 years.

2017, here I come.
